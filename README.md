# algorithms-and-data-structures-2-C
C++ labs I did in the second semester of learning about efficient algorithms and data structures
Lab 3 - First take on pointers, implements a linked list structure using pointers
Lab 4 - implements a binary tree, continually sorts it as you insert nodes
SmartPointerListHW - First take on smart pointers. 
Creates a dynamic array that allows you to continually append to an array using smart Pointers
